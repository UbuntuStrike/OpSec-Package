# OpSec-Package

The original code that was used for this OP Sec script was written by the late great An0nSec666 RIP!

Talking to him shortly before his death he agreed that his code should be fixed up to run on newer linux systems so that people who live in places where censorship is ripe would be able to share their voice while remaining anonymous, unfortunetly he passed before being able to do so, therefore, I took it upon myself to do just that and release it to the public.

This code only runs on Debian based systems such as Debian, Ubuntu, Mint etc but can likely be adapted to run on other linux distros, feel free to do so!

Usage:

git cloone
